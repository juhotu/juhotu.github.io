			<h2>If you happen to be interested in my personal life, here are a few of my memories listed</h2>

			<p>Starting things from the beginning I was born in Lappeenranta, Finland in 1998 and lived my first years at Imatra. Just before my first baby brother was born we moved to Lappeenranta. I now have a total of three baby brothers. Side note: I forbid any harmful usage of information in this site towards me or people around me.
			I was always about average in primary and secondary school. My strong subjects were mathematics, Finnish and English. I was good on literature as I read a lot back then. Nowadays I mostly reread Harry Potter. Later on secondary school I chose IT basics as an optional and had my first coding experiences with HTML and Visual Basic and had a first touch on media creation other than just Office suite products.
				<br><br>
			When I was 15 I built my first computer with help of my dad. At the time I also introduced myself to video editing which I really liked doing. I remember doing one video for art project and getting a ten out of ten grade from it.
			I made a simple cube game when I was around 15 and I have it saved <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!At97rHqJ-ZLaga9kUEUybnlq8dmOwg?e=tsI4iO" target="_blank">here</a>. I also experienced with Unreal Engine but that was only for fun.
			I started vocational school in 2014 and went to Finnish high school at the same time (it's called double degree in Finland). I learned more about what I can do with computers in that time but I also began to learn about myself too.
				<br><br>
			My whole life I have been very shy, but when I got my first job I had to start speaking louder and more often which eventually led to me not being so anxious about opening my mouth. I graduated in 2017 and continued doing the same job until the end of the year.
			I joined the army I/18 and did not like my time being there very much. Being asthmatic, and allergic to many things, my lungs especially did not enjoy but I managed to 'graduate' or move to reserve, whichever is the correct term, after six months. Then I had a few months off time and went back to my old job.
				<br><br>
			I started my university in applied sciences studies Fall 2019 while continuing to work about 20 hours a week. Met a lots of new people, joined a event producer course trough which I was one of organisers in events like Skynet Langames 25, Bonehill Gaming, Trailblazers Gaming Week and Saimaa Clutch Online.
			I consider myself a casual gamer so organising events related to gaming was a fun but time consuming experience. On some weeks I did more event stuff than I did go to school or work.

					<h3>HiFi and games</h3>
					<p>On my free time I like to play video games, watch movies or series and listen to music. At the time of writing I'm playing Minecraft, COD: Modern Warfare and Overwatch. Minecraft is an interesting game as being a sandbox game it can be played and modified in so many ways.
					When it comes to movie time I like fantasy, action and comedy and the same goes to series too.
						<br><br>
					I listen to many various types of music though mumble rap has not grown into me. I have also invested some to a good audio system, but I would need a better acoustic environment in my apartment and better noice insulation to unleash the full enjoyment.

			<h2>If you happen to be interested in my personal life, here are a few of my memories listed</h2>

			<p>Starting things from the beginning I was born in Lappeenranta, Finland in 1998 and lived my first years at Imatra. Just before my first baby brother was born we moved to Lappeenranta. I now have a total of three baby brothers. Side note: I forbid any harmful usage of information in this site towards me or people around me.
			I was always about average in primary and secondary school. My strong subjects were mathematics, Finnish and English. I was good on literature as I read a lot back then. Nowadays I mostly reread Harry Potter. Later on secondary school I chose IT basics as an optional and had my first coding experiences with HTML and Visual Basic and had a first touch on media creation other than just Office suite products.
				<br><br>
			When I was 15 I built my first computer with help of my dad. At the time I also introduced myself to video editing which I really liked doing. I remember doing one video for art project and getting a ten out of ten grade from it.
			I made a simple cube game when I was around 15 and I have it saved <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!At97rHqJ-ZLaga9kUEUybnlq8dmOwg?e=tsI4iO" target="_blank">here</a>. I also experienced with Unreal Engine but that was only for fun.
			I started vocational school in 2014 and went to Finnish high school at the same time (it's called double degree in Finland). I learned more about what I can do with computers in that time but I also began to learn about myself too.
				<br><br>
			My whole life I have been very shy, but when I got my first job I had to start speaking louder and more often which eventually led to me not being so anxious about opening my mouth. I graduated in 2017 and continued doing the same job until the end of the year.
			I joined the army I/18 and did not like my time being there very much. Being asthmatic, and allergic to many things, my lungs especially did not enjoy but I managed to 'graduate' or move to reserve, whichever is the correct term, after six months. Then I had a few months off time and went back to my old job.
				<br><br>
			I started my university in applied sciences studies Fall 2019 while continuing to work about 20 hours a week. Met a lots of new people, joined a event producer course trough which I was one of organisers in events like Skynet Langames 25, Bonehill Gaming, Trailblazers Gaming Week and Saimaa Clutch Online.
			I consider myself a casual gamer so organising events related to gaming was a fun but time consuming experience. On some weeks I did more event stuff than I did go to school or work.

					<h3>HiFi and games</h3>
					<p>On my free time I like to play video games, watch movies or series and listen to music. At the time of writing I'm playing Valorant, GTA online and Minecraft. Minecraft is an interesting game as being a sandbox game it can be played and modified in so many ways.
					When it comes to movie time I like fantasy, action and comedy and the same goes to series too. Witcher and GOT are living close to my heart.
						<br><br>
					I listen to many various types of music, though, mumble rap has not grown into me. I have also invested some to a good audio system, but I would need a better acoustic environment in my apartment and better noice insulation to unleash the full enjoyment.
